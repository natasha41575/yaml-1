### go-yaml fork

This package is a fork of the go-yaml library and is intended solely for consumption 
by kubernetes projects. In this fork, we plan to support only critical changes 
required for kubernetes, such as small bug fixes and regressions. Larger, general-purpose
feature requests should be made in the upstream go-yaml library, and we will reject such
changes in this fork unless we are pulling them from upstream.
